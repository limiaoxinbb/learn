Urban Traffic Flow Estimation System Based on Gated Recurrent Unit Deep Learning Methodology for Internet of Vehicles     基于GRU深度学习的车联网城市交通流估计系统

## 一、摘要

- Congestion in the world’s traffic systems is a major issue that has far-reaching repercussions,including wasted time and money due to longer commutes and more frequent stops for gas. The incorporation of contemporary technologies into transportation systems creates opportunities to significantly improve traffic prediction alongside modern academic challenges. Various techniques have been utilized for the purpose of traffic flow prediction, including statistical, machine learning, and deep neural networks. In this paper, a deep neural network architecture based on long short-term memory (LSTM), bi-directional version,and gated recurrent units (GRUs) layers has been structured to build the deep neural network in order to predict the performance of the traffic flow in four distinct junctions, which has a great impact on the Internet of vehicles’ applications. The structure is composed of sixteen layers, five of which are GRU layers and one is a bi-directional LSTM layer. The dataset employed in this work involved four congested junctions. The dataset extended from November 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017. Cleaning and preprocessing operations were performed on the dataset before feeding it to the designed deep neural network in this paper. Results show that the suggested method produced comparable performance with respect to state-of-the-art approaches.
- 世界交通系统的拥堵是一个影响深远的重大问题，包括由于通勤时间更长和加油站更频繁而浪费的时间和金钱。将现代技术融入交通系统，为显著改善交通预测以及现代学术挑战创造了机会。各种技术已经被用于交通流预测的目的，包括统计、机器学习和深度神经网络。本文构建了一种基于长短期记忆（LSTM）、双向版本和门控递归单元（GRU）层的深度神经网络架构，用于构建深度神经网络，以预测四个不同路口的交通流性能，这对车联网应用有很大影响。该结构由16层组成，其中5层是GRU层，1层是双向LSTM层。在这项工作中采用的数据集涉及四个拥挤的路口。数据集从2016年11月1日延伸到2017年6月30日。在将数据集馈送到本文设计的深度神经网络之前，对数据集进行了清洗和预处理操作。结果表明，所建议的方法与最先进的方法产生了相当的性能。

- Thus, again, there is a mix between two different analysisapproaches, ARIMA and NNs. Accuracy and interpretability have both seen significant gains thanks to the introduction of attention-based models in recent decades, particularly inthe area of natural language processing. As a result, we’re motivated to present attention’s use for doing things like predicting traffic.
- 因此，再次，有两种不同的分析方法，ARIMA和NN之间的混合。由于近几十年来引入了基于注意力的模型，准确性和可解释性都有了显着的提高，特别是在自然语言处理领域。因此，我们被激励去展示注意力在预测交通等方面的用途。
